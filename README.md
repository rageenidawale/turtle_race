# 🐢 Turtle Race Game

This is a fun **Turtle Race Game** built using Python's `turtle` module. Players can place bets on which turtle will win the race!

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Choose Your Bet:**  
   - When the program runs, you'll be prompted to choose a turtle color:  
     🟥 `red` 🟧 `orange` 🟨 `yellow` 🟩 `green` 🟦 `blue` 🟪 `purple`

2. **Watch the Race:**  
   - Each turtle moves randomly toward the finish line.

3. **Check the Winner:**  
   - If your turtle wins, you'll get a *"You won!"* message.  
   - Otherwise, you'll see *"You lost!"* along with the winning turtle's color.
